### V0.4
<p align="center">
  <img width="128" height="128" src="https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Misc/blob/main/media/ico_gdsp4.png?raw=true">
</p>

Introduction to new behaviours
* Better Tabs [#17](https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Script-Spliter/issues/17) (Can be change in editor settings)
* Sub-Split [#20](https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Script-Spliter/issues/20)
> Getting close to the end of the road: This release is focused on fixing bugs in the embedded editors, while the floating editors remain a challenge to deliver acceptable functionality in my opinion, but I'm sure it won't be impossible to achieve while maintaining compatibility.

### V0.3
<p align="center">
  <img width="128" height="128" src="https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Misc/blob/main/media/ico_gdsp3.png?raw=true">
</p>
Introduction to using tabs

* Tabs can be dragged to another window, now you can move one document from a window split to another window split.
* Backward and Forward has an internal function with the plugin. (Thanks to [@adancau](https://github.com/adancau))

>*I had initially planned to create a Notepad++ like functionality as a reference for version 0.3, but it has been decided to maintain the functionality and backward compatibility to avoid confusion for those using the plugin since version 0.1.*

### Drag and Drop
You can use tabs to drag and drop into another split window to switch between editors or you can drag directly from the script list and drop into the split window.

### Modify Backward and Forward buttons
You can modify the buttons by input resources in "script_spliter/io" folder,
seen in [Backward/Forward Request](https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Script-Spliter/issues/9#issuecomment-2917555511)

### Using Backward/Forward
It is per-window history, this means that if you've navigated through three different scripts within the window, moving back will only move between those three. The same happens when moving forward, and it's not affected by any other movements you've made in another window.
>[!TIP]
>In editor settings you have the checkbox: "using_as_next_and_back_tab" if you want use Backward/Forward move like Back/Next Tab.

### V0.2
<p align="center">
  <img width="128" height="128" src="https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Misc/blob/main/media/ico_gdsp2.png?raw=true">
</p>
The internal workflow has been modified, but the functionality of its predecessor version has been maintained.

This has been done to maintain compatibility when using shorteners like Ctrl + [1, 2, 3, 4] to change the split style, this might be broken in version 0.3, see the roadmap for details.

### Differences with version 0.1
* It more closely resembles the default editor window.
* Reduces window switching time.
* Allows you to zoom in on all windows.
* You may have a separate script documentation help window.
* Some visual aspects and configurable parameters in Editor Settings.
* More Features and Split Options.

>[!NOTE]
>This plugin uses another built-in plugin created by me called [Multi Split Container](https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Multi-Split-Container)

# Know Issues [↑](#table-of-contents)
### Version 0.2.3
The **PopScripts** (Floating Scripts) 
It still has some issues related to the editor focus, which means that if you switch scenes, some features like the search engine within the PopScript may be affected and become unresponsive.
